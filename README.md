Hi! My name is Mikhail Alfa (simply - Mike or, by nickname - alphamikle).

I am a professional Software Developer and have deep experience with Flutter. With many other technologies too, but in this project, I will show you, my dear viewer - how I can cook this cool thing.

Also, I will do it not because I have nothing to do but to show you my Open Source packages for Flutter in a real-world application.

And I will write a cycle of articles about that and will update this readme after every publication.
